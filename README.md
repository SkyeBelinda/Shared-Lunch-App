# A personal project to help make workplace shared lunches more co-ordinated and delicious

This was built throughout my time studying at Enspiral Dev Academy - to practice react and javascript.


```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm install
```

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`. The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/public`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with `npm run server`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.
